Our Story 
    It all started in a digital entrepreneurship class at Penn State Abington. A group of local Philadelphia IT students with the guidance of their Professor decided they wanted give people an easier way to enjoy media about the Pope. We set out to create a modern photo-sharing web service that would allow anyone to share their personal media about the Pope and have the option to sell this media to others via a digital marketplace. We believe this service is going to change not only how people perceive the Pope but also how they promote and interact with him. Our goal is to make the world a better place one Pope photo at a time.
